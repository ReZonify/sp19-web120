 <p>My name is Will Bulzomi. I grew up in a small suburb called Bonney Lake in western Washington. I absolutely love living in washington, because of the sports and the beautiful seasons we are blessed with here. I have lived in Oregon and Arizona as well. Some of my hobbies include basketball, skiing, laying out in the sun, playing video games, building computers and spending time with my family.</p>
 <p>I recieved a degree from Oregon State University in New Media. I focused on content production and marketing and to this day are some of my favorite proffessional topics. My interest in content has put me on the road to becomning a Web Developer. My passions for media and content make me an ideal partner for any client. I hope to bring their ideas to life and share what they do with the world one click at a time. </p>
